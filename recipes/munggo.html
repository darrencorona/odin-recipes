    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ginisang Munggo is a hearty Filipino stew made with mung beans, garlic,
      onions, and tomatoes, often simmered with spinach or bitter melon leaves
      and flavored with fish sauce. <br />
      It’s commonly cooked with pork, shrimp, or dried fish for added flavor.
      Nutritious, comforting, and usually served with rice.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds tomatoes, seeds removed, and chopped</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced (about 1 ½ cups)</li>
      <li>1 1-inch knob of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced (about ¼ cup)</li>
      <li>1 jalapeno thinly sliced, optional</li>
      <li>8 cloves fresh minced garlic</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon vegan chick’n bouillon paste or powder, sub vegetable
        bouillon paste or powder
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon MSG, optional</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups dried mung beans, rinsed</li>
      <li>1 13.5 ounce can of full fat coconut milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegan fish sauce</li>
      <li>6 cups baby spinach</li>
      <li>Crispy tofu, for serving, optional</li>
      <li>White rice, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Once the oil is hot, add the tomatoes, onion, ginger and jalapeno.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with the bouillon paste, the salt, pepper, and the msg and sauté,
        stirring often, <br />
        until the tomatoes are cooked down and the onions are translucent, 8 to
        10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add the garlic and sauté another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the mung beans and 6 cups of water and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to high and once it reaches a light boil, reduce the
        heat to low, <br />
        then cover and simmer until the mung beans are cooked through, about 1
        hour (if using split mung beans, check them at around 30 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the lid and add the coconut milk, soy sauce, vegan fish sauce,
        and another 1 to 2 cups of water (I usually end up adding an additional
        cup of water, <br />
        but depending on your preference, you may want to start with ½ cup if
        you like a thicker texture or up to 2 cups if you prefer it soupier).
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir until the coconut milk is thoroughly combined, then working in
        batches, mix in the spinach.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to stir until the spinach is slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Garnish with crispy tofu
        (optional) and serve immediately over rice (optional) and enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
